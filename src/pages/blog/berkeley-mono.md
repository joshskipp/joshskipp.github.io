> Berkeley Mono™ is a love letter to the golden era of computing. The era that gave rise to a generation of people who celebrated automation and reveled in the joy of computing, when transistors replaced cogs, and machine-readable typefaces were developed, for when humans and machines truly interfaced on an unprecedented scale.

Just look at this gorgous monospace font from U.S. Graphics Company (previously known as Berkeley Graphics). Their design principles and focus on utllity and function is a delight to see. I will be taking inspriation. I will be buying this typeface.
